# ReminderDiscordBot

Allows you to set reminders in discord

## plans
- it should be able to set a specific time based on the user's timezone
- store user timezones in a file or database (most likely using json)
- make a command that prints all the available timezones that the user can set to
- **Optional** the user can react to list of timezones to set their specific timezone
